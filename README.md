# Twitter Hashtag Sentiment Analyzer

I will use the Twitter API to retrieve tweets under a particular hashtag and perform sentiment analysis on them using natural language processing techniques. The sentiment analysis will categorize each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral based on the language used in the tweet.

The Twitter hashtag sentiment analyzer could be useful for businesses and organizations to understand the sentiment of their customers and followers. Additionally, it can be used by individuals to analyze the sentiment of tweets related to a particular topic, such as politics or sports.
